                Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico on how to increase wheat yields -
                part of his life-long war on hunger.

                Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:
            </h2>
            <ul class="dates">
                <li> <time class="time">1914</time> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1933</time> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,
                    thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1935</time> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
                    Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this
                    left scars on me."</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1937</time> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service
                </li>
                <li> <time class="time">1938</time> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to
                    budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who
                    teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1941</time> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but
                    is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
                    disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1942</time> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1944</time> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his
                    pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years,
                    his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties
                    for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1945</time> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat
                    yields</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1953</time> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling
                    American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of
                    Mexico's wheat.</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1962</time> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the
                    Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
                </li>
                <li> <time class="time">1970</time> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1983</time> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize
                    and sorghum yields</li>
                <li> <time class="time">1984</time> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                <li> <time class="time">2005</time> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."
                    Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of
                    arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
                    modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were
                    selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li class="shift"> <time class="time">2009</time> - dies at the age of 95</li>
            </ul>

                intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
